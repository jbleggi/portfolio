      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        After 15 years working in education and serving my community, I am changing fields with the intention of helping other service providers and organizations create effective, user-friendly software and workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may be new to software development, but I am not new to the professional environment! I have spent the first part of my career seeking progressively challenging roles while I honed leadership and advocacy skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to a fresh start where I can continue to refine my new skill set while contributing to my community in a productive, collaborative, and solution-oriented work environment.
