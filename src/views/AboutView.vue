    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      After 15 years working in education and serving my community, I am changing fields with the intention of helping other service providers and organizations create effective, user-friendly software and workflows.
      <br>
      <br>
      I may be new to software development, but I am not new to the professional environment! I have spent the first part of my career seeking progressively challenging roles while I honed leadership and advocacy skills.
      <br>
      <br>
      I look forward to a fresh start where I can continue to refine my new skill set while contributing to my community in a productive, collaborative, and solution-oriented work environment.
